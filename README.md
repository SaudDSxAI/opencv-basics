# OpenCV Basics Project

## Overview
This project is a collection of Python scripts demonstrating fundamental concepts and operations in OpenCV. It covers image reading, color manipulation, drawing, transformations, contour detection, and more. The project reflects my journey in learning computer vision, starting from the basics and building a strong foundation for more advanced applications.

## Features
- **Image Reading & Video Capture:** Load and display images and videos using OpenCV.
- **Color Manipulation:** Change image color spaces and separate color channels.
- **Drawing & Writing:** Draw shapes and write text on images programmatically.
- **Image Transformations:** Apply resizing, rotation, and other geometric transformations.
- **Contour Detection:** Find and visualize contours in images.
- **Utility Functions:** Explore various OpenCV functions for image processing.

## How It Works
1. Each script in the `openCV_py_basics/` folder demonstrates a specific OpenCV concept or technique.
2. Scripts are modular and can be run independently for focused learning and experimentation.
3. Example image (`my.png`) is provided for testing and demonstration.

## My Learning Journey
Through this project, I learned:
- The basics of image and video processing with OpenCV.
- How to manipulate image data and perform common computer vision tasks.
- The importance of hands-on experimentation for mastering new libraries.
- Building reusable code snippets for future computer vision projects.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Required: `opencv-python`, `numpy`.
   - Install with: `pip install opencv-python numpy`
2. **Run Scripts:**
   - Navigate to the `openCV_py_basics/` directory.
   - Run any script (e.g., `python read_image_videos.py`) to see the concept in action.
3. **Experiment:**
   - Modify scripts or use your own images to deepen your understanding.
